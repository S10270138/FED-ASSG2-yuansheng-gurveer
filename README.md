MokeSell - Online Marketplace
Overview
MokeSell is a modern online marketplace that enables users to buy and sell items seamlessly. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, our platform ensures a smooth user experience with an intuitive layout, a structured category-based browsing system, and an engaging reward system.

With a clean purple and white theme, MokeSell focuses on providing all essential e-commerce features without unnecessary complexity. The platform is accessible, easy to navigate, and includes features such as listings, shopping carts, direct messaging, and a reward-based coin system.

Design Process
Who is this website for?
MokeSell is designed for buyers and sellers who want a hassle-free and efficient platform to conduct online transactions. The goal was to reduce the friction in online selling, making it easy to list items, browse through categories, chat with buyers/sellers, and manage purchases in one seamless interface.

Design & Wireframes
The design process was centered around ease of use and minimalistic yet engaging UI. We focused on creating an intuitive navigation experience while ensuring all features remain accessible. The wireframes, mockups, and icon designs were created using Figma. The Figma files are included in the design folder inside this repository.
